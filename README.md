# python-challenge

Summary: In this assignment, I was tasked with the assignment of handling two seperate datasets: Budget_data.csv, which consists of two columns - "Date" and "Profit/Losses" and Election_data.csv, which consists comprises three columns - "Voter ID", "County", and "Canidate". Each dataset was utilized for distinct tasks, which will be explained further below.

PyBank Folder:
  Comprising the main.py script, the budget_data.csv file, and the output file encapsulating the analysis results.  
  Within this challenge, I was tasked with creating a python script to analyze the financial records of the company. I will utilize the Budget_data.csv to calculate the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over an entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period along with their average, and identify the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including their respective dates and amounts. The findings will be written to a text file.

PyPoll Folder:
  Comprising the main.py script, the poll_data.csv file, and the output file encapsulating the analysis results.  
  I was assigned the responsibility of developing a Python Script to conduct an in-depth analysis, encompassing the total number of votes casts, a comprehensive list of canidates who received votes, the percantage of votes secured by each canidate, and the total count of votes received by each canidate. The findings will be written to a text file.
